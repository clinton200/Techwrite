### Example Markdown Syntax Explained

- **#** denotes a first-level heading (like the project name here).
- **##** is a second-level heading (introduction, prerequisites, etc.).
- Lists are created by starting lines with * for unordered lists or 1., 2., 3., etc., for ordered lists.
- **Text** within double asterisks is bold.
- *Text* within single asterisks is italicized.
- Links can be created using the syntax `[text](url)`.
- Code snippets can be displayed by surrounding them with triple backticks ``` or indenting by four spaces.
- Bulleted lists start with `- ` or `* ` or `+ `.

## Additional Tips

- Keep the README short and to the point. If it gets too long, consider linking to external documentation or wiki pages.
- Use images and diagrams if they help explain complex concepts.
- Keep the README updated as the project evolves.
